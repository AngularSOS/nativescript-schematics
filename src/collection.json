// By default, collection.json is a Loose-format JSON5 format, which means it's loaded using a
// special loader and you can use comments, as well as single quotes or no-quotes for standard
// JavaScript identifiers.

// We read package.json using a require() call, which is standard JSON.

  // separate collection using the format collectionName:schematicName).
  // The factory is required, except when using the extends field. The the factory can
  // overwrite the extended schematic factory.
